    "#### 3 wilderbeast and 3 lions need to cross a crocodile infested river to escape the approaching fire\n",
    "- There is a raft that can take a maximum of two animals\n",
    "- All of the animals are on the east bank of the river where a forest fire is approaching\n",
    "- When the raft is crossing the river an animal is needed to steer the raft, both wilderbeast and lions know how to steer the raft\n",
    "- If at any time the lions outnumber the wilderbeast their natural instinct kicks in and the quiz is over **(BADLY)**\n",
    "- They need to find the fastest way to transport all the animals across to the west side\n",
    "- The quiz is only a success if all six animals make it to the west bank without being eaten by some other animal\n",
    "- Swimming across will prove fatal"
